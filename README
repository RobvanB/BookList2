This is the second version of the BookList application.
Original project: https://github.com/RobvanB/BookList
New version: https://github.com/RobvanB/BookList2

The app loads an XML file with books from the DataCrow application (http://datacrow.net).
The file is picked up from DropBox. The File needs to be called dcexport.xml and needs to be located in the 
application folder of your dropbox account (/apps/BookList2/dcexport.xml)

This version has the following changes:
* Uses the new DropBox API that uses oAuth and app folder
* User can add wildcards at begin and end of search through check boxes
* Function to add records removed - this served no purpose
